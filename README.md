A Chrome extension that improves the default double-click text selection behavior to intelligently select common text patterns beyond just words.

## Features

-   **Smart Selection**: Double-click to select entire emails, URLs, file paths, and UUIDs in one action
-   **Time-Saving**: Stop manually dragging to select complex text patterns
-   **Customizable**: Enable or disable specific pattern recognition via the settings popup
-   **100% Private**: Your data remains on your own machine.

## Install

[Install for **Free**]() <!-- TODO: Add chrome extension link inside parenthesis -->

## Use Cases

-   **Developers**: Quickly select file paths, UUIDs or URLs in documentation and code
-   **Email Users**: Easily grab complete email addresses
-   **Web Researchers**: Copy entire links with a simple double-click

## How It Works

When you double-click on text, Better Double Click Select analyzes the surrounding content to detect if the text is part of a larger pattern (like an email address or URL). If detected, it automatically expands the selection to include the entire pattern.
